# Python Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains data structures and algorithms concepts and questions in Python. 

## :dart: Objective

The open source community has helped me a lot during my interview preparations and studies while I was in my undergrad. I always wanted to give something back to the community. In my endeavour to contribute something back, I will be uploading data structures and algorithms questions in Python in this repo. Feel free to contribute and get in touch! :smiley:

## :file_folder: Structure of the repository

As of now, the repository contains a file called [`useful_links.md`](useful_links.md) and 2 main directories: **Data Structures** and **Algorithms**.

### Data Structures

Contains all data structure questions categorised into sub-directories like stack, queue, etc according to their type.

1. Array 
2. Dictionary
3. Binary Search Tree  
4. Linked List  
5. Stack  
6. Graphs  
7. Circular Linked List

### Algorithms

This directory contains various types of algorithm questions like Dynamic Programming, Sorting, Greedy, etc. The current structure of this directory is like - 

1. Dynamic Programming
2. Math
3. Sorting

### Useful Links

You can find useful links in this repository in the different markdown files. Below is a table of contents.

## :clipboard: Things need to be done

As you can see, the repo is still in its infancy. Here are some key things in the to-do.

1. Queue questions
2. Algorithms  
    2.1. Dynamic Programming  
    2.2. Greedy   
3. More questions in data structures, especially for graph, circular linked list, tries, heaps and hash.
